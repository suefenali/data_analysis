# Income per Person analysis
## by Suelen Fenali


## Dataset

The income per person of a country is a measure of how much money is earned by an individual.
This is used as an indicator of the living conditions and quality of life in that country ([Investopedia])(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-per-capita.asp). Many different variables can be related to the income amount of an area. The data selected to this analysis is provided by [Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), and it is composed by four main indicators.

**Mean years at school**
The average number of years of school attended by men and women 25 years and older.

**Employment by sector**
This indicator is composed of three sectors, which are: Agriculture, Industry and Service. For every sector there's the percentage of all employees that work in that sector for each country.

**Employment by status**
The status includes three categories, which are: Family workers, Salaried workers and Self-employed workers. For every status there's the percentage of all employees that work that way for each country.

**Income**
Income per person, which is calculated by: Gross Domestic Product / Country Population


This analysis intends to look for correlations among the indicators and the income per person in a country.

## Summary of Findings

The three indicators are related to the income of a country. Also, the indicators among themselves can be related. Countries with a smaller income show lower means of years in school, more agriculture sector and more family and self employed workers. Nations with a bigger income demonstrate higher means of years in shool, more service sector and more salaried workers.
